I trying to enhance existing things instead of redoing them from scratch. Every time I spend time on a workaround for some issue, I think about how many discoveries were missed, because people were struggling with the same workaround instead of dealing with more interesting things at the end of the day. 

I am always looking for a way to save time so that more software could be made perfect without rewriting it. Unable to work with patches on Windows, I wrote [patch.py](https://code.google.com/p/python-patch/) so that I could have mode control over problems with applying different patches on different systems.

I am an idealist. I am hacking on Gratipay to feel how the real world of money is different from what we want. I am learning  the economy, trying to pave a way to backup specific goals / causes more easily and look if open and transparent economy with cooperative gameplay is possible.

I am a perfectionist. While working more with Python I found a lot of things that were imperfect. Things that bring poor usability, break the flow and ruin the experience in the long run. The architecture that is in old times was just called `pythonic`. I tried to push things hard to make Python a better tool and deserved a status of well-known troll in certain circles.

I am interested in research about how humans absorb information, learn and communicate to deal with computers, interested to find a way to augment limited human abilities with new descriptive ways to see the complexity of systems that we evolved over time. "Dealing with complexity" is the thing I can't stop thinking about.

I am obsessed. I am certain that we needed to overcome complexity of descriptions to solve complicated problems by applying technology in a non-trivial or non-obvious ways. And technology and code alone is not enough. We need stats and human studies to understand what's going on with real world outside of our binary cells.

I am depressive. I have an illness of psychosomatic nature that can not be fixed with the level of income that I have. Stress decreases lifespan, and job is increasing the stress. There is a choice of going into isolation, reduce the income and the load to minimum, consume a lot of sedatives to prolong you life, or... try to push the technology so that a cure can become possible one day.

I am unhappy about the world. New people are born in a in a new world that already has less freedom and less resources for them that it had before.  They have to fight with previous generations for power and resources. There is no visible balance and no idea of what to look for, how to synchronize with others and change something for the better. In USSR people once dreamt about space, not because they wanted to be there first, but because of the dream. Now we don't have dreams - only the cold competition and [failing market economy](http://www.oxfam.org/en/research/wealth-having-it-all-and-wanting-more), which is not designed to work with basic limited resources.

When I need to switch aways from my own problems, I help open source projects that I like - with clean architecture and as little restrictions as possible on how people would use them, such as Roundup, SCons, Gratipay etc. It is like a piece of magic, an impossible miracle in a world where you need to force people to pay you to survive.

I am looking forward to help with new open and transparent tools that augment people with improving development workflow and lowering barrier to entry. Tools that people can reuse and tune to their liking, in their own projects, tools that help visualize the structure, dispell the complexity,  and bring more fun to all of us, and not only to those who are capable to win in business.
