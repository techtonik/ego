Everything is mostly dark here, and it can spoil your mood, but at least it's honest.

It is hard to say whenever it is ADD or OCD that led me to being accused a few times of being lazy, unable to concentrate on things, failing to follow orders, keep communication, relationship etc. I guess it is fashionable now to have such excuse. This gets quite depressive, because you have to turn down offers to stop betraying and disappointing people, who are, judging from your occasionally smiling face, have big hopes in what will follow and are probably disappointed in performance and efficiency in the end. I constantly switch to something seemingly irrelevant.

Sometimes I feel sad and angry about most joys in life, because I feel myself a slave who needs to concentrate on being efficient and productive, unable to do anything else at this point. I don't waste time in casino, don't drink, don't spend it with friends and don't even go out for sports anymore. My comfort zone excludes watching movies, reading books - I only skim technological papers and articles, but that doesn't help. Ideas overflow with no real capacity to implement any of them is daunting and blurs the focus. I liked to spill out ideas, but even that joy is eventually replaced by coding algorithms in my neural networks, and the excitement gradually fades. I am inclined that you can be either productive or creative. The problem of the modern world is that you MUST be productive. And it is quite sad to become nothing if you had a different mindset and now trying to "fix" yourself to survive.

If I could enter the flow where ideas could be turned into advantage, backed up with external support to remove the obstacles, there could be some hope. Most proposals nowadays revolve around full-time contracts, NDA and stopping writing open source code in favor of quick code that maximizes short-term profits.

I don't think that I live in forsaken land or there is something wrong with people or the economy they got themselves into - it is all natural human processes. In fact, I had a joy of observing the transition process from social country to the capitalistic one and I saw many things screwed up on a way by a natural limitation of humans to separate emotions from facts in a pursue of "freedom". People don't have control over their lives and so am I - living with my parents, just skipping days. I can not escape the reality to run a few experiments, because I see that they need to build up some capacity first, and capacity needs more resources. All good things in the world are made by teams, and I am not the one who can sustain the moment of working in them.

People are trying to be happy and I am not. Life is a misery, because big things happen while you're digging through daily chores like a worm. Who would you be when your high level life support system is switched off? Just a body fill of mutations and viruses that is trying to survive? The neural network that is so busy with maintenance of biosystem that is falling apart? If you don't need anyone in this screwed up digital reality, why would anyone need you?


It is not that I am tired of thinking about the stuff that surrounds me. It is that I tired of doing nothing and I don't see that anything happens to prevent disasters promoted by media and disasters that are not so popular over it, such as the overpopulation. It is hard to be happy when nobody seems to have time to monitoring these the issues and tell you - hey, everything is ok. Presidents don't decide anything. They exist solely for the purpose of giving hope to people. Hope is very important, but it is all futile. Modern economics consumed everything and it doesn't even start to slow, just starting new conflicts fights and clashes with people who try to resist. It was born to spend resources, not to preserve and grow them. And the "good positive business guys" don't seem to help anyone.

We could help new generation get human friendly tools to solve problems they will have to live with, but instead we reinvent wheels, clash over copyright laws, proudly wear badges that "unix is for hackers", close open knowledge databases and sell everything we can seize with our minds in cute greedy packages. Is there still a place for cooperative gameplay in this "civilized" world and not only for competitive rat races?

"Be creative" they say. I spent the first part of my life earning money for open experiments. I don't have anything left. Not that smart, or dumb, not balanced - you can name any reason why "the success" didn't happen. The energy to get the income is much higher than you can afford. There is no time for anything else. We are all buzzing about "innovation", but why people with ideas and without money are so insecure to suffer in this "knowledge economy"? If you produce an idea, everybody wants you to be a genius or MBA to fulfil it. "Investors" want you to deliver good presentation for them with detailed plan on what are you going to invent in the next decade. Grants are no better, if not worse. Everybody want you to be responsible, nobody trusts you anymore even if you contribute the stuff freely, and there is no such thing as an experiment. Only development is allowed. Heaven for ones and slavery for the others.

The natural process of Modern Economy wants to get excuse for what they've done with filtering people with different abilities. If you have a different mindset, be prepared to handle labels like OCD, ADD and others attached to you "for free". You can even prove they really exists, for a price. You will draw your ROI or KPI daily as a basis of your collaboration to get yourself a place under the sun. Is that all envy and greed who are guilty? A lack of resources? Or just a gameplay that we can't escape except by the most obvious and useless opt-out action.
